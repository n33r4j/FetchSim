Gazebo Tips

1) To reset a gazebo simulation for python,

	import rospy
	from std_srv.srv import Empty

	rospy.init_node('reset_world')

	rospy.wait_for_service('/gazebo/reset_world')
	reset_world = rospy.ServiceProxy('/gazebo/reset_world', Emptry)

	reset_world()

2) The default models are located at /usr/share/gazebo-11/media/models

3) The actor's joint positions are published to /gazebo/<world_name>/skeleton_pose/info
	You can try writing a node that publishes to this topic ?
